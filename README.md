# ASP.NET Core API - Blazor Shopping Cart
## Elezzba Store

This project on GitHub is a web application built using ASP.NET Core, Blazor, and Entity Framework Core. The application implements a shopping cart feature, allowing users to browse and purchase products online.

The application consists of two parts: a backend API built using ASP.NET Core, and a frontend Blazor web application. The backend API provides endpoints for managing products, users, and orders, while the frontend Blazor web application consumes these endpoints to display products and allow users to add them to their shopping cart.

The project uses Entity Framework Core as an ORM to interact with a SQL Server database, which stores information about products, users, and orders. The application also includes authentication and authorization features, allowing users to create accounts, login, and manage their orders.

The code is well-organized and follows best practices for building web applications using ASP.NET Core and Blazor. The project includes detailed documentation and instructions for setting up and running the application locally.

the project isn't complete and still under development
